# C++ Definition Paster README

A simple tool to help you generate c++ definitions.

## Quick Start

1. Select or place the cursor inside a function prototype.

1. Press `ctrl+c`.

1. If the extension recognizes the syntax (and the editor language is C/C++), the function body will copied. 

1. Otherwise, the `ctrl+c` will just work normally.

1. You can now press `ctrl+v` to paste it whereever you like.

## Tips

- You can use `ctrl+insert` to enforce a normal copy.

- If you want to change the key binding, go to File - Preferences - Keyboard Shortcuts and search for `cpp-def-paster.copyDefinition`.

This extension is still in early development; any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
